This project was made with the goal to combine TeamSpeak and Discord. The goal: A platform that looks modern like Discord but runs the server like TeamSpeak. DCTS allows you to run your own Discord Server like a TeamSpeak server, in simple words.

Since you can host the server yourself you're also the one in control of the data. This could be important for people who value their data privacy.

## Obfuscated?
Yes. Its not open source. I dont want my work to be copied but yet i still want people to be able to use it. I'll find a better solution in the future.

<br>

## Licensing
The software will be free for personal use and for non-profit communities. Commercial use will require a license (or maybe not). 

<br>

## How to install
Requires node.js to be installed (tested with v16.16.0). Afterwards execute the following commands inside the app's directory.
```
npm install
node .
```

## Tested Versions

## Connecting to your server
Once you've installed the server and its running, you can open your browser and enter the server's ip and add the port 2052.<br>
Example: localhost:2052
